      Overview
    </h3>
    <p>
      How I Met Your Mother is an American sitcom, created by Craig Thomas and
      Carter Bays for CBS and was directed by Pamela Fryman. The series is a
      joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox
      Television and syndicated by 20th Television. It was loosely inspired by
      Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York City. Known
      for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements,
      How I Met Your Mother was popular throughout its run. The show was
      nominated for 30 Emmy Awards and won ten. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the
      People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years
      after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite
      Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV
      Comedy Actor twice.
